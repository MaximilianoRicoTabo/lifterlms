  + The site options `lifterlms_certificate_bg_img_width`,
  `lifterlms_certificate_bg_img_height`, and
  `lifterlms_certificate_legacy_image_size` are now used only for certificates
  and certificate templates created using the classic editor.
    + The settings, found on the Engagements Settings screen, are hidden by default.
    + During the database upgrade from versions earlier than 6.x, an site option, `llms_has_legacy_certificates`  is added when at least one certificate is found. This option will display the settings so they can continue to be used for legacy certificates.
    + After migrating all certificates on a site, the settings will still display. In order to remove them from the screen a developer can either delete the option `llms_has_legacy_certificates` or return `false` from the filter `llms_has_legacy_certificates`.
