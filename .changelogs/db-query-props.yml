  + Public access to properties of the abstract `LLMS_Database_Query` has been deprecated.
    + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$found_results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_found_results()`.
    + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$max_pages`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_max_pages()`.
    + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$number_results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_number_results()`.
    + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$results`. The property is no longer publicly writable but can be read via `LLMS_Database_Query::get_results()`.
    + Public access to class property `LLMS_Database_Query::$query_vars`. The variable as a whole cannot be publicly accessed, instead use `LLMS_Database_Query::get()` and `LLMS_Database_Query::set()` to read and write to the array.
    + The above changes were made to the abstract class `LLMS_Database_Query` but the following concrete classes that utilize the abstract are also affected by this change: `LLMS_Query_User_Postmeta`, `LLMS_Student_Query`, `LLMS_Query_Quiz_Attempt`, `LLMS_Events_Query`, and `LLMS_Notifications_Query`.
