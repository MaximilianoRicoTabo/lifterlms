entry: The CSS for `.llms-spinning` and `.llms-spinner` elements is no longer
  loaded as part of the `lifterlms.css` and `admin.css` files, instead it is
  loaded dynamically when `window.LLMS.Spinner` functions are called. In some
  cases CSS overrides to these elements which relied on CSS rule load order may
  no longer successfully override the default CSS rules. These overrides may
  need to be updated to have more specific selectors in order to ensure the
  overrides are retained.
