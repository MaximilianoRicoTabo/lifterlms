entry: The `LLMS_Student` object can be instantiated as an empty object and
  bypass current user autoloading. In the future this may affect integrations
  using the `lifterlms_new_pending_order` action hook which will receive an
  "empty" student object during order setup by gateways utilizing new
  AJAX-powered checkout endpoints.
