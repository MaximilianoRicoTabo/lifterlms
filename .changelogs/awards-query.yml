  + Added `LLMS_Awards_Query`, used for querying data about awarded certificates
  and achievements.
    + The method signature `LLMS_Student::get_achievements()` and `LLMS_Student::get_certificates()` now use this class under tho hood.
    + The previous method signature, which passed data into a direct SQL query, is now deprecated.
