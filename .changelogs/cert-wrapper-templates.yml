entry: Certificates no longer use the `header.php` and `footer.php` files from
  the site's theme, instead custom templates
  (`templates/certificates/header.php` and `templates/certificates/footer.php`)
  are used instead. These templates are minimal and exclude theme wrappers which
  reduces the visual conflicts encountered from theme wrappers, backgrounds, and
  more, especially when printing certificates.
